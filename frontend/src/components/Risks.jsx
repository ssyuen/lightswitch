                                    to trade the shares of these ETFs. These ETFs will provide less information to

                                    investing in individual bonds which involve risks such as interest rate risk,
                                    inflation risk, credit and default risk, call risk, and liquidity risk. The issuer
                                    of the bond or bond type can carry additional risks.

                                    in interest rates. If interest rates rise, bond prices will generally decline,
                                    despite the lack of change in both the coupon and maturity. The degree of price
                                    volatility due to changes in interest rates is usually more pronounced for
                                    longer-term securities. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a
                                    maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until
                                    maturity is not possible.

                                    purchasing power of a bond's interest and principal.

                                <CollapsePanel header={"Credit and Default Risk"}>Bonds and their issuers generally
                                    receive a credit grade rating by independent rating agencies. An ETF can have a
                                    stated objective to invest in investment grade or better or in lower grade bonds
                                    with higher yields. Changes in credit rating can also affect prices. If one of the
                                    major rating services lowers its credit rating for a particular issue, the price of
                                    that security usually declines. Less creditworthy issuers may be more likely to
                                    default on interest payments or principal repayment. If a bond issuer fails to make
                                    either a coupon or principal payment when they are due, or fails to meet some other
                                    provision of the bond indenture, it is said to be in default.

                                    be redeemed or paid off at the issuer's discretion before maturity. Typically, an
                                    issuer will call a bond when interest rates fall, potentially leaving investors with
                                    a capital loss or loss in income and less favorable reinvestment options.

                                    large number of issuers and variety of securities. For example, with limited
                                    exceptions for some large more actively traded issues, the chances of finding a
                                    specific municipal bond in the secondary market at any given time are relatively
                                    small. Selling prior to maturity can present a challenge for municipal bond
                                    investors due to the fragmented and thinly traded nature of the market.
